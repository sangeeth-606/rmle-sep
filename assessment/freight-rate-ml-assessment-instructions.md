# Machine Learning Engineer Assessment Instructions

## Objective
- Use `data/train_test.csv` as the labeled development data.
- Decide how to split and validate the development data.
- Explore, clean, engineer features, validate, and model the data as you see fit.
- Run your trained model on every load in `data/validation.csv`.
  - `data/validation.csv` contains the 12,000 loads requiring final predictions. Each row contains the load features and a unique `load_id`.
  - Run your trained model on every row in `data/validation.csv`.
  - `data/validation_predictions_template.csv` contains the same 12,000 `load_id` values.
  - Fill the template’s `predicted_rate` column and save the completed file as `validation_predictions.csv`.
- Refer to the `README.md` for setup instructions.

## Submit
- An accessible GitHub repository containing your solution code, dependencies, and run instructions.
- `validation_predictions.csv` containing exactly:
  - `load_id,predicted_rate`
- A PDF or DOCX report containing:
  - Your approach to validate test/train data and split.
  - The fixed December prediction chart produced by the provided `score.py`.
- A 2-3 minute Loom video going over the following:
  - Key findings from exploring the data.
  - Any data-quality issues identified and how you addressed them.
  - Reasoning behind the chosen model.
  - Training and validation approach, including how the data was split.
  - A brief walkthrough of the most important parts of your code.
